## Release

To release a new version:

1. update the version number in `version.rb`
2. run `bundle exec rake build:checksum`
3. move the built gem to project root
4. run `bin/checksum` to create the missing SHA256 checksum
5. move the built gem back to `pkg/`
6. run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org][rubygems].

NOTE: You will need to have a public key in `certs/`, and list your cert in the
`gemspec`, in order to sign the new release.
